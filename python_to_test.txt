print("hello World!")

The " print() " is a function that prints thing which is inside the pahrenthesis.

For example....   
function_name(argument)

A function may have 
1.an effect
2.a result
3.a component or argument ( important for a function )
  Some python functions do not need an argument.

About "\n"
===========

The backslash (\) has a very special meaning when used inside strings - this is called the escape character.
The letter n placed after the backslash comes from the word newline.

print("Plusxultra","CJ7","MotionMonster")

print("My name is ",end=" ")
print("Plusxultra")

print("My", "name", "is", "Monty", "Python.", sep="-")

print("My", "name", "is", sep="_", end="*")
print("Monty", "Python.", sep="*", end="*\n")

Format the output!
==================

print("    *")
print("   * *")
print("  *   *")
print(" *     *")
print("***   ***")
print("  *   *")
print("  *   *")
print("  *****")

Try to:

1.minimize the number of print() function invocations by inserting the \n sequence into the strings
2.make the arrow twice as large (but keep the proportions)
3.duplicate the arrow, placing both arrows side by side; note: a string may be multiplied by using the following trick: "string" * 2 will produce "stringstring" (we'll tell you more about it soon)
4.remove any of the quotes, and look carefully at Python's response; pay attention to where Python sees an error - is this the place where the error really exists?
5.do the same with some of the parentheses;
6.change any of the print words into something else, differing only in case (e.g., Print) - what happens now?
7.replace some of the quotes with apostrophes; watch what happens carefully.

The print() function is a built-in function. It prints/outputs a specified message to the screen/consol window.

To call a function (function invocation), you need to use the function name followed by parentheses. 
You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses. You must separate arguments with a comma, 
e.g., print("Hello,", "world!"). An "empty" print() function outputs an empty line to the screen.

Python strings are delimited with quotes, e.g., "I am a string", or 'I am a string, too'.

Computer programs are collections of instructions. 
An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed, e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.

Positional arguments are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position, 
e.g., the second argument is outputted after the first, the third is outputted after the second, etc.

Keyword arguments are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location, 
but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.

The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print() function. 
The sep parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments 
(e.g., print("H", "E", "L", "L", "O", sep="-"), 
whereas the end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement.
